u1-autopublish
==============

Script which automatically publishs a new file in a specific directory.  
Sadly Ubuntu One got shut down on July 2014 therefore the script does not work anymore.  

why my script?
==============
It automatically pastes the public Ubuntu One link to your clipboard which you can paste with CTRL+V or middle mouse click.

usage
-------------
just run the script with the directory which should be monitored for file changes and automatic sharing.  
example:  
```bash
/home/user/u1-autopublish/autopublish.py /home/user/Ubuntu\ One/public
```
